Hello! Thanks for contributing.  For the fastest response and resolution, please:

   Bad: "Map zoom is broken". 
   Good: "camera.setZoom(...) throws an exception for zoom levels where no tiles exist"

 - Ensure that you have tested on a physical device, not just a simulator.

 - For build issues: Can you reproduce it on a clean install of the example app? Please include full steps to reproduce

 - Include a link to a minimal demonstration of the bug, ideally a single component with one MapView.

 - Ensure you can reproduce the bug using the latest release.
